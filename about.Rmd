title: "R as a tool for Network Analysis"
---

Even though R was not built for the purpose of network analysis, but the availability of extensive libraries have made R a very powerful go to platform for network analysis. The two libraries that we will be using are **visNetwork** and **igraph**. The first library will allow us to create interactive network graph, while the second will allow us to run some network analysis and answer some questions.
